This is a basic program that converts an age into dog years. I am aware that this is not accurate in the sense that dog years are not linear; but it is the common understanding that most people consider it to be a ratio of 1:7. This program utilises print statements, effective variable use, and correct use of operators and pythonic conventions. I have demonstrated the Future-Proofing and Aesthetics consideration by making my program give clear output, with comments outlining what the code does.
